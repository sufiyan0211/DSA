# Implementing Dijkstra Algorithm

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Given a weighted, undirected and connected graph of <strong>V</strong> vertices and an adjacency list adj where adj[i] is a list of lists containing two integers where the<strong> first </strong>integer of each list <strong>j</strong>&nbsp;denotes there is <strong>edge</strong> between i and j&nbsp;,&nbsp;second integers corresponds to the <strong>weight</strong> of that&nbsp;&nbsp;edge .&nbsp;You are given the source vertex <strong>S</strong> and You to&nbsp;Find the shortest distance of all the vertex's from the source vertex <strong>S</strong>.&nbsp;You have to return a list of integers denoting shortest distance between <strong>each node</strong> and Source vertex<strong> S</strong>.</span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Note: </strong>The Graph doesn't contain any negative weight cycle.</span></p>
