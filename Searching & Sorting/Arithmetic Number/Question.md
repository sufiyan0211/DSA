# Arithmetic Number

### Given three integers  'A' denoting the first term of an arithmetic sequence , 'C' denoting the common difference of an arithmetic sequence and an integer 'B'. you need to tell whether 'B' exists in the arithmetic sequence or not.


<strong>Example 1: </strong>
<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:</strong> A = 1, B = 3, C = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explaination:</strong> 3 is the second term of the 
sequence starting with 1 and having a common 
difference 2.</span></pre>

<strong>Example 1: </strong>
<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:</strong> A = 1, B = 2, C = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explaination:</strong> 2 is not present in the sequence.</span></pre>



<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Your Task:</strong><br>
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function <strong>inSequence()</strong> which takes A, B and C and returns 1 if B is present in the sequence. Otherwise, returns 0.</span></p>
