# 239. Sliding Window Maximum
## Description

You are given an array of integers `nums`, there is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return the max sliding window.

### Example 1:

**Input:** nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
**Output:** [3,3,5,5,6,7]
**Explanation:**

| Window position | Max |
|----------------|-----|
| [1 3 -1] -3 5 3 6 7 | 3 |
| 1 [3 -1 -3] 5 3 6 7 | 3 |
| 1 3 [-1 -3 5] 3 6 7 | 5 |
| 1 3 -1 [-3 5 3] 6 7 | 5 |
| 1 3 -1 -3 [5 3 6] 7 | 6 |
| 1 3 -1 -3 5 [3 6 7] | 7 |

### Example 2:

**Input:** nums = [1], k = 1
**Output:** [1]

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`

## Topics

- Array
- Queue
- Sliding Window
- Heap (Priority Queue)
- Monotonic Queue

## Hints

1. How about using a data structure such as deque (double-ended queue)?
2. The queue size need not be the same as the windowâ€™s size.
3. Remove redundant elements and the queue should store only elements that need to be considered.
