# Sort a stack

<p>Given a stack, the task is to sort it such that the top of the stack has the greatest element.</p>

<strong> Example 1: </strong>
<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:
</strong>Stack: 3 2 1
<strong>Output: </strong>3 2 1</span>
</pre>


<strong> Example 2: </strong>
<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:
</strong>Stack: 11 2 32 3 41
<strong>Output: </strong>41 32 11 3 2</span></pre>


<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Your Task:&nbsp;</strong><br>
You don't have to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function&nbsp;<strong>sort()&nbsp;</strong>which sorts the elements present in the given stack. (The sorted stack is printed by the driver's code by popping the elements of the stack.)</span></p>
